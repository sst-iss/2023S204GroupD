### Abstract


Acetaminophen has been used as a pain relief drug for at least about half a century. Acetaminophen, being used so regularly, can also cause great harm as much as it causes great relief. As such, our research, which aims to measure the amount of acetaminophen in 7 different tablets and ensure that they are below the recommended amount, which is 500mg. To do so, we utilised spectrometry, which uses light to detect the concentration of acetaminophen. After research, there is evidence that the amount of acetaminophen in tablets are at a safe value, and that human life is not at threat. The results of this research can be used to catalogue levels of acetaminophen in tablets to better present such information. They can also be used to inform the public and increase awareness on the leathality of acetaminophen. Limitations and areas for further research are also discussed.
